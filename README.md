NOTICE:
=======
Current setup isn't ready for real client management:
------------------------------------------------------
<Current State
<Uses localStorage (data disappears when browser is cleared)
<No real user authentication (just demo login)
<No database to store user accounts or loan data
<No way to track actual signups
<Can't manage multiple clients securely


What You Need for Publishing:

Real Authentication System - Secure user registration and login
Database Storage - Persistent data storage for all users and loans
Multi-tenant Architecture - Each client sees only their own data
Admin Dashboard - Track all signups and manage clients
Data Security - Row Level Security (RLS) to protect client data
Backup & Recovery - Enterprise-grade data protection
After Supabase Integration, I can immediately help you:

Convert localStorage authentication to real Supabase auth
Set up database tables for users, loans, repayments, settings
Implement Row Level Security for data isolation
Create admin views to track all signups
Add email notifications for new registrations
Set up proper user session management
Implement data validation and security
Next Steps:

Click the green Supabase button in the top right of Lovable
Connect to Supabase (free tier available)
Once connected, I'll help you migrate everything to a production-ready backend
This integration is essential for a professional loan management system that can handle real clients safely and securely.
